# About the Project
This project was a unity game to primarily satisfy my railway obsession and if done, to publish commercially.

## Discontinuation
Since Kozomo is about to become my first commercial project, and my interest in data oriented procedural game development has highly increased, this project is abandoned.
After releasing Kozomo, i'll probably start reworking on this game with another programming language.
